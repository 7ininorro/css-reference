OldSkoolVerb Plus v1.2 offers you a comprehensive set of parameters that allow you to achieve various reverbs ranging from plate reverb to room reverb to hall reverb sound.

In comparison to the freeware version, the Plus version features an additional spatialization module that provides additional control over the reverb's spatial image and greatly increases the reverb's density. You can also adjust the stereo width, damping, modulation, pre-delay and other settings to fine-tune the reverb effect.

You can adjust the stereo balance, crossfeed, early reflection panning, and late reflection panning to create a realistic or exaggerated spatial image. You can also use the spatialization module to create mono-compatible reverbs or enhance the stereo separation of the source signal.
