- Reconsider making a huge fortress. It may look impressive, but it will also make you a target for the mutants. They can destroy your structures and attack you in large numbers[^1^]. Instead, try building a treehouse or a small cabin that is hidden and easy to defend.
- Create a water collector early. Water is essential for survival, but not all water sources are safe to drink. You can use a turtle shell to collect rainwater, which is clean and free[^1^]. You can also craft a water skin to carry water with you.
- Craft that bow. The bow is a simple but effective weapon that can help you hunt animals and fight enemies from a distance[^1^]. You can craft it with sticks, cloth and rope. You can also craft arrows with sticks and feathers.
