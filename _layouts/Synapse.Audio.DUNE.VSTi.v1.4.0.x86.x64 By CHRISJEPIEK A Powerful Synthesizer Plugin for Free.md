Synapse Audio DUNE is available as a VSTi plugin for Windows and Mac, compatible with 32-bit and 64-bit hosts.

One of the best features of Synapse Audio DUNE is the wavetable oscillator, which contains 69 additional waveforms that can be modulated to create complex and evolving sounds. You can also use FM synthesis, filter FM synthesis, and wavetable synthesis to expand your sonic possibilities. DUNE also supports up to 8 unison voices per oscillator, which can be further shaped by the modulation matrix.

Whether you are into trance, techno, ambient, pop, or any other genre of electronic music, you will find something to inspire you in Synapse Audio DUNE.

Another new feature in Synapse Audio DUNE is the dual filter mode, which lets you use two filters in series or parallel, with a balance control to mix the output. You can choose from 14 filter types, including the original zero-delay feedback filter and several new models based on classic analogue circuits. The filters also have a drive knob for adding saturation and warmth, and an FX section with four effects: distortion, phaser, chorus and EQ.
 
Synapse Audio DUNE also boasts a revamped effect section with seven high-quality effects: distortion, chorus, phaser, flanger, delay, reverb and EQ. You can reorder the effects by dragging them around, and adjust their parameters with the dedicated knobs. The effects sound great and add a lot of depth and character to the synth sounds. The reverb, in particular, is very lush and spacious.

One of the most impressive aspects of Synapse Audio DUNE is its arpeggiator and sequencer. The arpeggiator has seven modes, including the new dynamic mode that adapts to the number and order of keys pressed. You can also set the octave range, step length, swing, velocity and gate time for each step. The sequencer lets you create up to eight patterns of up to 32 steps each, with independent control over pitch, velocity and modulation. You can also record your own patterns in real time or step mode.
 
Synapse Audio DUNE is a synth that combines traditional synthesis techniques with innovative features and a superb sound quality. It is easy to use and very CPU-friendly, making it ideal for any kind of music production. It comes with over 500 presets that showcase its versatility and potential, but you can also create your own sounds using the powerful wavetable editor and modulation matrix. Synapse Audio DUNE is a synth that you will not regret buying.
