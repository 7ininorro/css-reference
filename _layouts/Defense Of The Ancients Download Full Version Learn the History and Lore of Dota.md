Defense of the Ancients (DotA) is a custom scenario for Warcraft III, based on the "Aeon of Strife" map for StarCraft. The objective of the scenario is to destroy the opponents' "Ancient". The two teams' ancients are heavily guarded structures at opposing corners of the map. Players use powerful units known as heroes, and are assisted by allied heroes and AI-controlled fighters called "creeps". As in role-playing games, players level up their hero and use gold to buy equipment during the mission.
 
DotA is one of the most popular mods for Warcraft III, with millions of players worldwide. It has spawned several spin-offs and inspired other games such as League of Legends and Dota 2. If you want to join the fun and play DotA, here are the steps you need to follow:
