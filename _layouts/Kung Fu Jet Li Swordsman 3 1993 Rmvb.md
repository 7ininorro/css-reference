Kung Fu Cult Master is a 1993 Hong Kong wuxia film directed by Wong Jing and starring Jet Li, Sammo Hung, Chingmy Yau and Sharla Cheung. It is based on the novel The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber by Jin Yong, which is the third and final installment of his Condor Trilogy.
 
The film follows the adventures of Zhang Wuji (Jet Li), a young martial artist who becomes the leader of the Ming Cult, a secret sect that possesses two legendary weapons: the Heaven Sword and the Dragon Saber. Along the way, he encounters various enemies and allies, including a crazy monk attached to a rolling boulder (yup!), a beautiful but deadly swordswoman (Chingmy Yau), and his childhood sweetheart (Sharla Cheung).

Kung Fu Cult Master belongs to the wuxia genre, which literally means "martial heroes". Wuxia is a form of Chinese fiction and film that depicts the adventures of sword-wielding chivalrous heroes in ancient China. Wuxia stories have their roots in some early tales from 300â200 BC, but became popular as a genre in the 20th century, especially after the 1960s.
 
Wuxia films often feature elements of fantasy, romance, history and philosophy. They also showcase elaborate fight choreography, stunning cinematography, and spectacular visual effects. Some of the most influential wuxia filmmakers include King Hu, Chang Cheh, Zhang Yimou, Ang Lee and Tsui Hark. Some of the most acclaimed wuxia films include Come Drink with Me (1966), Dragon Inn (1967), A Touch of Zen (1971), Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000), Hero (2002) and The Grandmaster (2013).

Wuxia films often explore themes such as loyalty, honour, justice, freedom, revenge, and morality. They also reflect the historical and political contexts of their times, sometimes challenging the official ideologies and censorship of the authorities. For example, wuxia films in the 1930s were influenced by the anti-Japanese sentiment and the nationalist movement in China, while wuxia films in the 1960s and 1970s were shaped by the cultural revolution and the diaspora of filmmakers to Hong Kong and Taiwan.

Wuxia films also have distinctive conventions that set them apart from other genres. Some of these conventions include:
 
- The use of martial arts skills and techniques, such as qinggong (lightness skill), neigong (internal skill), and qimen dunjia (the art of war and geomancy).
- The use of weapons, especially swords, daggers, and spears, as well as hidden weapons and flying guillotines.
- The use of special effects, such as wirework, slow motion, and CGI, to create spectacular fight scenes and flying sequences.
- The use of music, sound effects, and voice-over narration to enhance the mood and atmosphere of the film.
- The use of costumes, props, and sets to create a stylized and exotic world of ancient China.
